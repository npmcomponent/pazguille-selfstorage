# Self-Storage JS

It's a client-side library for caching JavaScript resources in the localStorage. The main objective of this project is to intended to save bandwith and time. You can store any other JavaScript library from the same origin (same domain).

When a new visitor comes to your web site for the first time, you makes a request to JavaScripts resources. Then stores the resources in the localstorage and you can use it locally.

Therefore, when the visitor come back to your web site if the resources are availables locally, loads from the localstorage, saving bandwith and time.

It's [cross-browser compatible](http://caniuse.com/#search=localstorage):
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Opera
- Safari
- IE10
- IE9
- IE8
- Safari Mobile
- Android Browser
- Blackberry Browser

## Installation

	$ component install pazguille/selfstorage

See: [https://github.com/component/component](https://github.com/component/component)

## How-to
First, add the library:
```html
<script src="http://mydomain.com/build/build.js"></script>
```
Then, require the selfstorage:
```js
var selfstorage = require('selfstorage');

```
Now, starts to load and store any library! It makes a request once, then it loads from LocalStorage.
```js
selfstorage.use('http://mydomain.com/jquery.js', function () {
    // Some code here!
    // jQuery is available
});
```

## API

### selfstorage#use(url, callback)
The use(url, callback) method first checks if it is available locally. If not, it makes the request  and stores the source in the localstorage. Then, executes the given callback.

### selfstorage#get(url)
The get(url) method returns the current value associated with the given url.

### selfstorage#remove(url)
The remove(url) method deletes the url from the collection.

### selfstorage#clear()
The clear() method cleans all the cache (for that domain).
